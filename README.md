# üéµ Songs In Your Neighborhood 
## Summary
Originally created in 2021 for Python programming labs, Songs In Your Neighborhood was designed as a **personal song recommendation app**. It allowed the user to find songs from a chosen Spotify playlist based on a reference song and selected audio features.

## ‚ö† Spotify Web API Update & Project Status
üö® Update (Feb 2025): Spotify recently [removed access to audio features](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api) (e.g., danceability, energy) from their API, which were a **core part** of this project.  

‚ùå As a result, the original functionality is no longer working.   
üîÑ The project is in transition and may evolve over time. I may explore adapting it to focus on user behavior analysis, such as listening habits and trends.

##  How It Used to Work
1) Pick a Spotify playlist to use as a recommendation source.
2) Choose a reference song to base the recommendation on.
3) Select audio features (e.g. energy, danceability, key) to guide the recommendation.
4) Find similar songs in your "neighborhood" that you might like.  

## üõ† Technologies used
- Python
- pandas
- Spotify Web API (Spotipy)
- GUI (Tkinter)
- KNN-style similarity search using feature distances
- matplotlib (for visualizing nearest neighbors)


üö® Note: Due to Spotify API changes, the recommendation system based on audio features is no longer functional.

## Planned upgrades (outdated due to the API update)
- GUI major upgrade
- Data visualization changes
  - interactive annotations (hover over feature) 
- Built-in music player to play snippets of recommended songs
